        <h1>How to Use this Website</h1>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>This website experience only works for Harris County, Texas!</li>
            <li>Turn on your phone's map application, google maps, apple maps, etc.</li>
            <li>Start this website. (steps 1 and 2 can be done in either order)</li>
            <li>Click the green button, which lets your device know you're okay with this website using your location. 
                You may also need to change other phone settings. See privacy information below.</li>
            <li>You can now go ahead and drive or bike.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You might need to turn off the "sleep" functionality of your phone, so it doesn't go to sleep. 
            Without this, you'll need to touch the screen occassionally to keep it "awake". </p>
        <p>
            Currently, it needs your native map running at the same time no iOS. 
            Without it, your location may stall out and not refresh properly. 
            This will eventualy no longer be needed in a future update. 
            Directions and this map will speak at the same time. As this is a demo, it speaks all the time. 
            Eventually, it will only speak when you enter or leave a floodplain. </p>
        <p>
            Finally, this is brand new and a work in progress! Please let us know your experiences and drop us a line. See the feedback section below.

            <p>This map is a representation and approximation of the relative location of geographic information, land marks and physical addresses. 
                This floodplain polygons were exported at a specific moment in time based on tentative FEMA FIRMs of a specific version. 
                FEMA floodplain maps evolve over time. Do not assume this is the latest! 
                Additionally, as the climate changes, FEMA floodplain maps are increasingly out of date. 
                Finally, the data for your location comes from your device, which has uncertainty as well. 
                Please check specific addresses against FEMA floodplain maps anytime you need accurate information. 
                Do not rely on this application for accurate information or make any decisions on the basis of information provided by it! </p>
            <p>Flooding is not limited to floodplains. 
                Many Harris County areas outside floodplains got flooding damage during Hurrican Harvey.</p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
            <h4>This website is meant to supply SPOKEN floodplain information while ON THE MOVE!</b>
        </h4>
       
        <p>
            While other floodplain maps listed below under "Other Floodplain Resources" are best used sitting at home in front of a computer, 
            this service is meant to be used while in a car or on a bike. 
            People can be told when they enter or leave a floodplain without
            having to actively interact with a device by clicking through many screens and typing in addresses.
        </p>
        <p><a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-12/real-estate-listings-with-flood-scores-shift-home-shopper-habits?sref=fRZXrT1O'>Studies</a> have shown 
            that putting floodplain information inside home buyers workflows change how they percieve the information and changes their home 
            purchasing behavior. </p>
        <p>
            This website is based on the hypothesis that changing how and when people experience floodplain information may change their purchasing behavior.
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Change <i>how</i> you experience floodplain information:
                    <uL>
                        <li>from... an abstract map </li>
                        <li>to... information experienced in real-time while physically experiencing a place. </li>
                    </uL>
                </li>
                <li>Change <i>when</i> you experience floodplain information:
                    <uL>
                        <li>from... separate in time from looking at a house and potentially days later. </li>
                        <li>to... information experienced in real-time and potentially even before you see a house. </li>
                    </uL>
                </li>
            </oL>

        <h2>Information about Floodplains</h2>
        <p>This information is from <a href="https://www.eng.hctx.net/Consultants/Floodplain-Management/Floodplain-Information">Harris County Engineering Department</a>.</p>
        
        <!-- <h3>Harris County Floodplain</h3> -->

        <p>
            Harris County is the third largest county in the United States with a population greater than three million.
            It covers 1,788 square miles with 1,500 channels totaling about 2,500 miles in length within twenty-two
            watersheds. The land use consists of urban, residential, commercial, and heavy industrial areas. In the last
            century, over 30 thunderstorms, tropical storms, and hurricanes have caused flooding in Harris County. Each
            bayou and creek include areas known as "floodplains," where water collects, pools, and flows during the
            course of a natural storm event. </p>
        <p>
            A floodplain is defined as any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. These
            areas are classified as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), and are located in a 100-year flood zone. The
            term "100-year flood" can be misleading. It does not mean that the flood will occur every 100 years; rather
            it is the flood elevation that has a 1- percent chance of being equaled or exceeded each year. Harris County
            has Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) that identify all floodplain areas within the county limits. </p>

        <p>Floods are one of the most common hazards in the United States. Flood effects can be local, impacting a
            neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins and multiple states. It is important
            to be aware of flood hazards no matter where you live. Even very small streams, gullies, creeks, culverts,
            dry streambeds, or low-lying ground that appears harmless in dry weather can flood.</p>

        <h4>Risk</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Floods are the #1 natural disaster in the United States.</li>
                <li>Just an inch of water can cause costly damage to property. As little as six inches of moving water
                    can knock you off your feet or move your car.</li>
                <li>Most homeowners insurance doesn't cover flood damage.</li>
                <li>More than 50 percent of properties in high-risk areas remain unprotected by flood insurance; all
                    properties in high-risk areas need to be protected with flood insurance.</li>
                <li>Between 20 and 25 percent of all flood insurance claims are filed in low-to moderate-risk areas.
                </li>
                <li>New construction can increase flood risk, especially if it changes natural runoff paths.</li>
                <li>More than 5 million Americans are protected with flood insurance but millions more are unaware of
                    their personal risk for property damage or options for protection.</li>
                <li>For building in high flood risk areas, there is a 26 percent chance of experiencing a flood during
                    the life
                    of a 30-year mortgage, compared to a nine percent chance of experiencing a fire.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Impact</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Flood losses in the United States averaged $2.4 billion per year for the last decade.</li>
                <li>The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has paid nearly $16 billion in flood insurance claims to
                    policyholders during the 2005 hurricane season (as of August 31, 2006.)</li>
                <li>Federal disaster assistance is usually a loan that must be paid back with interest and is only
                    available when a disaster has been federally declared.</li>
                <li>In the last 52 years, nearly 1,000 flood events have been designated as federally declared
                    disasters.</li>
                <li>Nearly 75 percent of all federally declared disasters over the past five years involved flooding.
                </li>
            </ul>
