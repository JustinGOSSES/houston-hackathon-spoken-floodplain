        <h1>Information about Floodplains</h1>

        <h2>Harris County Floodplain</h2>

        <p>
            Harris County is the third largest county in the United States with a population greater than three million.
            It covers 1,788 square miles with 1,500 channels totaling about 2,500 miles in length within twenty-two
            watersheds. The land use consists of urban, residential, commercial, and heavy industrial areas. In the last
            century, over 30 thunderstorms, tropical storms, and hurricanes have caused flooding in Harris County. Each
            bayou and creek include areas known as "floodplains," where water collects, pools, and flows during the
            course of a natural storm event. </p>

        <p>
            A floodplain is defined as any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. These
            areas are classified as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), and are located in a 100-year flood zone. The
            term "100-year flood" can be misleading. It does not mean that the flood will occur every 100 years; rather
            it is the flood elevation that has a 1- percent chance of being equaled or exceeded each year. Harris County
            has Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) that identify all floodplain areas within the county limits. </p>

        <p>
            County strives to protect the natural and beneficial functions of floodplain areas. Harris County has
            some unique situations. After devastating flooding in 1935, the state legislature created the Harris County
            Flood Control District (HCFCD). As stated in the Flood Insurance Study, HCFCD governs drainage and flood
            control, while the county engineer governs floodplain management and permit programs with technical
            assistance from HCFCD. Although both agencies are under the jurisdiction of Commissioners’ Court, they are
            separate agencies. In 2003, Harris County Commissioners’ Court adopted the Draft Floodplain Management Plan
            for qualification to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program’s (NFIP) Community Rating System
            (CRS). </p>


        <p>Floods are one of the most common hazards in the United States. Flood effects can be local, impacting a
            neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins and multiple states. It is important
            to be aware of flood hazards no matter where you live. Even very small streams, gullies, creeks, culverts,
            dry streambeds, or low-lying ground that appears harmless in dry weather can flood.</p>


        <h2>Flood Facts</h2>

        <h3>Risk</h3>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Floods are the #1 natural disaster in the United States.</li>
                <li>Just an inch of water can cause costly damage to property. As little as six inches of moving water
                    can knock you off your feet or move your car.</li>
                <li>Most homeowners insurance doesn't cover flood damage.</li>
                <li>More than 50 percent of properties in high-risk areas remain unprotected by flood insurance; all
                    properties in high-risk areas need to be protected with flood insurance.</li>
                <li>Between 20 and 25 percent of all flood insurance claims are filed in low-to moderate-risk areas.
                </li>
                <li>New construction can increase flood risk, especially if it changes natural runoff paths.</li>
                <li>More than 5 million Americans are protected with flood insurance but millions more are unaware of
                    their personal risk for property damage or options for protection.</li>
                <li>For building in high flood risk areas, there is a 26 percent chance of experiencing a flood during
                    the life
                    of a 30-year mortgage, compared to a nine percent chance of experiencing a fire.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Impact</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Flood losses in the United States averaged $2.4 billion per year for the last decade.</li>
                <li>The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has paid nearly $16 billion in flood insurance claims to
                    policyholders during the 2005 hurricane season (as of August 31, 2006.)</li>
                <li>Federal disaster assistance is usually a loan that must be paid back with interest and is only
                    available when a disaster has been federally declared.</li>
                <li>In the last 52 years, nearly 1,000 flood events have been designated as federally declared
                    disasters.</li>
                <li>Nearly 75 percent of all federally declared disasters over the past five years involved flooding.
                </li>
            </ul>
